// OOP - OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

// An object might contain other objects but they're still different objects.

// Objects also have characteristics that are used to describe them. For example, a car can be red or blue, a mug can be full or empty, and so on. These characteristics are also called attributes. An attribute describes the current state of an object.

// Objects can have multiple attributes (the mug can be empty, red and large).

// So, the following three dimensions describe any object in object oriented programming: identity, attributes, behavior.

// In programming, an object is self-contained, with its own identity. It is separate from other objects.

// Each object has its own attributes, which describe its current state. 
// Each exhibits its own behavior, which demonstrates what they can do.
